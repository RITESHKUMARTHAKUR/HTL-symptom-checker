# Heal

In this COVID time, it was difficult for people to go to doctors every time. What if, if people can check themselves by using an app at their home? So they won't have to visit a doctor every time they have minor symptoms and we tried to solve this problem by creating an app named HEAL.

### What Heal does?
Heal is a symptom checker app. If you are not feeling well you can come here and ask Heal about the possible cause of your illness. It will require only a few minutes to find the cause and the best part about heal is, you do not need to write all the things by yourself, we integrate a voice assistant in the app powered by Dasha AI so you just need to answer a few questions and you are good to go.
